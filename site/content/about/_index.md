I'm a senior internal audit leader at a large regulated financial institution. My work sits at the intersection of analytics, audit methodology, and organizational capability—figuring out how to make data-driven audit work in practice, not just in PowerPoints.

That means dealing with real constraints: regulatory scrutiny, data access limitations, teams with uneven technical skills, and leadership expectations that don't always match what the data can actually say. I find that gap interesting.

## What I Focus On

**Audit Planning Analytics**
Using data to make risk assessment more rigorous and defensible. Not just automated scores—actual analytical frameworks that can survive a regulator asking "how did you decide to audit this?"

**Continuous Monitoring and Risk Sensing**
Building monitoring programs that provide real signal, not just noise. The hard part isn't the technology; it's defining what you're actually looking for and why.

**Control Testing Automation**
Automating substantive testing in ways that are explainable, reproducible, and audit-ready. If you can't explain the logic to an examiner, it doesn't count.

**Audit Methodology and Quality**
The unglamorous work of making sure the analytical process itself is sound. Documentation, review, version control, and the discipline to say "we don't have enough data to conclude that."

**Skills Assessment and Capability Building**
Assessing where audit teams actually are analytically (not where they think they are) and building training and hiring strategies that close the real gaps.

**Analytics Governance**
Policies, standards, and review processes that allow analytics to scale without becoming a liability. Particularly important in regulated environments where the analytics themselves can become exam topics.

## A Guiding Principle

Analytics in internal audit have to be **credible, explainable, and defensible under regulatory scrutiny**. That's a higher bar than most analytics contexts. It shapes everything—methodology choices, documentation standards, how we communicate findings, and which tools we use.

It also means I'm skeptical of hype. A lot of "AI in audit" conversation is solution-looking-for-a-problem. I try to write about what actually works and why.

## This Site

I started writing here to develop my thinking and to contribute something useful to the audit community. There's a lot of content about audit analytics that's either too theoretical or too vendor-driven. I'm trying to write the kind of thing I wish I could find—practical, honest, occasionally opinionated.

I'm not always right. When I change my mind, I'll say so.
