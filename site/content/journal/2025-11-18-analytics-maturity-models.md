Been sitting with maturity models today, specifically why they feel simultaneously useful and wrong.

The useful part: they give people a shared vocabulary and a sense of direction. "We're at level 2, we want to get to level 3" is a lot easier to discuss than trying to describe in the abstract what capability looks like. The framework creates common ground.

The wrong part: they imply a single path, and the path usually isn't the problem. Most audit functions I talk to know roughly where they are and roughly where they want to be. What they can't figure out is how to actually move. The maturity model doesn't help with that. It describes the destination, not the route.

I've been trying to articulate what the route actually involves. I think it's something like:

1. Identify where the current bottleneck actually is (not where you think it is)
2. Fix that specifically, not the whole thing at once
3. Repeat

The bottleneck is almost never "we need better tools." It's usually one of: unclear ownership, inadequate documentation, no review process, or insufficient skill in a specific person or a specific area.

What frustrates me about most maturity conversations is the implicit assumption that the path is linear—that you have to fix everything at level 2 before you can do anything at level 3. I don't think that's right. You can have pockets of level 4 capability alongside level 1 practices, and that's fine as long as you're honest about it.

The question I'm trying to answer: what's the minimum you need to fix to unlock the next meaningful improvement in capability? Not "how do we get to level 5?" but "what's the one constraint that's holding us back right now?"

Still working on how to articulate this in a way that's useful without being prescriptive.
