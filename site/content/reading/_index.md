I read pretty broadly. Not everything here is about internal audit. Some of it is analytics, leadership, decision making, technology, history, or just something that made me rethink how systems actually work.

If I link to it, it moved my thinking in some way. Maybe it challenged an assumption. Maybe it explained something more clearly than I could. Maybe it connected dots I had not fully connected yet.

I add a short note so you can decide quickly if it is worth your time. I know attention is limited. If it is abstract but not useful, it probably will not make the list.

You do not have to agree with any of it. I often do not. But it is all worth thinking about.
