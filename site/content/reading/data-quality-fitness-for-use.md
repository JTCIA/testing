commentary: "I keep coming back to whether 'fitness for use' is really the right mental model for audit evidence. In business analytics, data quality is relative to the decision you're making. In audit, there's an additional layer: the data has to be fit for an assurance conclusion that will survive external scrutiny, not just fit for the original business purpose. This framework is useful for structuring data quality assessment in audit work, but I think it needs an 'audit evidence' lens layered on top—particularly around completeness and auditability of the data's provenance."
