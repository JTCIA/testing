commentary: "This piece on learning organizations kept me thinking about how audit teams actually develop analytical capability. Senge's core argument—that real organizational learning requires psychological safety, shared mental models, and systems thinking—applies directly to the analytics capability problem. The teams I've seen develop the fastest aren't the ones with the best tools or the most training budget. They're the ones where it's genuinely safe to try something, get it wrong, and learn from it without career consequences. That's a culture question, not a technology question."
