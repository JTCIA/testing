The best ways to reach me:

**LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/jterwin](https://linkedin.com/in/jterwin)
This is where I'm most active. Send a connection request with a note about what you're working on.

**Email:** [jt@audit-analytics.com](mailto:jt@audit-analytics.com)
For longer conversations, questions about something I've written, or collaboration ideas. I read everything; I don't always respond quickly.

**What I'm happy to talk about:**
- Audit analytics methodology and implementation
- Building analytics capability in audit teams
- What actually works (and doesn't) in practice
- Anything you're genuinely curious about

**What I'm not looking for:**
- Vendor pitches or unsolicited product demos
- Guest post swaps or SEO link trades
- "Thought leadership" opportunities that are really just ads

If you're an audit professional thinking about hard problems, I'm interested. If you're selling something, I'm not.
