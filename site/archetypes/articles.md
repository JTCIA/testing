<!-- Writing checklist:
     - Hook in the first paragraph — what's the problem or tension?
     - 3-5 key points, each with a concrete example or implication
     - End with a takeaway or open question
     - Tone: smart colleague over coffee, not executive memo
     - Reading time target: 5-8 minutes (~1200-2000 words)
-->

[Opening: state the problem, tension, or observation that motivated this piece. Don't bury the lede.]
